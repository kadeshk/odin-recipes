<h3>Ingredients</h3>    
<b>For the Cookie Base</b>

<ol>
        <li>1 medium (3" diameter) cookie </li>
        <li>5 1/2 ounces butter </li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar </li>
        <li>2 cups cake flour </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 tbsp caramel </li>
        <li>21 ounces caramels </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream </li>
        <li>1 piece chocolate </li>
        <li>1 pound semisweet chocolate or chocolate-flavored candy coating </li>
      </ol>
      <h3> Steps to Make It</h3>
      <b> Make the Cookie Base </b>
      <b>Step 1</b>
      <p> Gather the ingredients. </p>
      <b>Step 2</b>
      <p> Heat the oven to 350 F. Prepare a 13-by-9-inch baking pan by lining it with aluminum foil and spraying the foil with nonstick cooking spray. </p>
      <b>Step 3</b>
      <p> Place the butter and the granulated sugar in the bowl of a large mixer and beat them together on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. </p>
      <b>Step 4</b>
      <p> Add the flour and salt. Mix on low speed just until the flour is incorporated. </p>
      <b>Step 5</b>
      <p> Scrape the dough into the prepared pan and use your hands to press it into a thin, even layer. </p>
      <b>Step 6</b>
      <p> Bake the shortbread for a total of 18 to 20 minutes, turning halfway through so it cooks evenly. When it is finished, it should be a light golden brown color. Don't overcook it or it will be very crumbly. Allow the shortbread to cool completely. </p>
      <b>  Make the Caramel Layer  </b>
      <b>Step 1</b>
      <p> Gather the ingredients and make the caramel layer while the shortbread is cooling. </p>
      <b>Step 2</b>
      <p> Place the unwrapped caramels in a large microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons of cream. If your caramels are very stiff, you might want to increase the cream by an additional spoonful. This candy bar works best if the caramel is not too hard or chewy, so adding some cream when melting the caramels helps make it silky smooth. </p>
      <b>Step 3</b>
      <p> Microwave the caramels until melted and smooth, stirring after every 30 seconds to incorporate the cream and prevent overheating. </p>
      <b>Step 4</b>
      <p> Pour the melted caramel over the shortbread cookie crust and smooth it into an even layer. Refrigerate the pan to set the caramel completely, about 1 hour. </p>
      <b> Coat the Bars With Chocolate </b>
      <b>Step 1</b>
      <p> Gather the ingredients</p>
      <b>Step 2</b>
      <p> Melt the chocolate or candy coating in a microwave-safe bowl and stir until completely smooth. </p>
      <b>Step 3</b>
      <p> Remove the caramel-covered bars from the pan by using the foil as handles. </p>
      <b>Step 4</b>
      <p> Cut the bars into thin, finger-width sizes. It helps to cut the entire sheet of bars in half width-wise, then cut about 10 bars from each half, for a total of about 20 long, thin bars. You can vary the size to suit your needs. Use a large, sharp knife to prevent the cookie base from crumbling. </p>
      <b>Step 5</b>
        <p>Use dipping tools or forks, dip the bars in the melted chocolate, covering them completely. Place the dipped bars on a foil-lined tray and repeat until all bars are dipped. </p>
        <b>Step 6</b>
        <p>Refrigerate the tray to set the chocolate, about 10 minutes. </p>
